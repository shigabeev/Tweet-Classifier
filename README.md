# Tweet Classifier
<p>The target of this project is to make qualitative analysis software that will make assumptions on topics that twiiter user is often talking about.</p>

<ol>
<p>At the moment this code can do:</p>
  <li>Download and collect tweets from selected source (get_tweets.py, takes name of twitter acoount as an argument)
  <li>Count frequency of word usage in downloaded .csv file (freq.py, takes name of .csv as an argument)
  <p>What it will probably do in nearest time:</p>
  <li>Merge frequency tables from several sources and count probabilities.
  <li>Count Naive Bayesian equation to calculate the posterior probability for each class.
